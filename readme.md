This is a small solution to day 1 of Advent of Code 2021 using rust.

I just wanted something small to code during a few free minutes and decided that a small puzzle like this one would do ^^


You can do wathever you want with this piece of code but of course there is no kind of warranty (obviously).

Have a great day!
